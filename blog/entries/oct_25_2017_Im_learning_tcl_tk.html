<!-- Intro                                                                   -->

<h2>Intro: </h2>
<p>
    I'm bit surprised how I'm keeping the blog posts flowing! I'm really do,
    I tried before to keep blogging but every time I failed... seems that now I'm
    making it ;D
</p>

<p>
    Well, let's talk about something <b>really</b> interesting!
    <br>
    I really love <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, while I do not consider
    myself as a <i>git guru</i>, I know quite a bit to get my job done without
    any hassles about it and try to follow some <i>good practices</i>!

    <br>
    My git usage is basically in terminal, I set some
        <a href="https://github.com/N2OMatt/dots/blob/master/base/git.sh">
            bash aliases
        </a>
    that really makes my life easier, and gee I must admit, everything is really
    gorgeous in git ;D
</p>

<p>
    While I almost do everything in command line, there's one use case that I
    really prefer using the gui, namely making non trivial commits.
    <br>
    By non trivial commits I mean stuff that are related but span more than one
    file and changes in the same file but that belongs to multiple commits by
    nature.
</p>

<p>
    When I found myself into that use case, I always use <tt><b>git gui</b></tt>.
    I really like it, since it is available on all platforms that need to use and
    furthermore is a standard git <i>program</i>.
    <br>
    I mean, all my knowledge and time invested on it is preserved when I need
    to switch to another platform - This is one of the top reasons that I prefer
    using the terminal instead of any other means to work with git as well.
    <br>
    So no matter if I'm using Windows (unfortunately) in GoEpik or GNU/Linux in
    <a href="http://www.amazingcow.com">Amazing Cow</a> or
    <a href="http://letslive.green"> Let's Live Green</a> I always working with
    a program that I know, therefore my time is saved to working in interesting
    things not to learn a tool for nothing!
</p>

<h2>git gui tweaks: </h2>
<p>
    That's great! But I found some stuff on <tt><b>git gui</b></tt> that I don't quite
    like so much! I mean, the tool is great but with sine tweaks I think that
    it would be much nicer!
    <br>
    The features that I would like to see is:
    <ol>
        <li>
            A field to filter the files that are shown in the list of <b>unstaged changes</b>.
        </li>

        <li>
            A double click in the list of <b>unstaged changes</b> or <b>staged changes</b>
            would open the given file in the editor.
        </li>

        <li>
            In the <i>file's content viewer</i>, would be great if it has an edit mode.
            This way I could change something trivial without going back to editor!
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>The magic of Free Software: </h2>
<p>
    Since git is Free Software, <tt>git gui</tt> is available to me hack and thinker
    with it - How not to love something that empowers its users like that?
    <br>
    So I downloaded its <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/git-gui">sources</a>
    and found that it was written in <a href="https://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a>!
    I already heard about the language but never actually had laid my eyes on anything
    written on it!
    <br>
    Well I having nothing to talk about it right now since I just read some bits
    of code - but seems that Tcl is pretty amazing language with that command like
    constructs!
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- The plan                                                                -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>The plan:</h2>
<p>
    So I found myself with a very interesting problem to solve, without any prior
    experience on it and with the possibility to help some people that might want
    that tweaks too - Man that's a kind of problem that I really love to engage!
</p>

<p>
    But to really do anything, first I need learn some Tcl/Tk (obviously) and
    being a book addict like I'm, the first think that I did was check if
    anything related with Tcl/Tk was available in
    <a href="http://estantevirtual.com.br">Estante Virtual</a> - A Brazilian website
    that unite a lot of used bookstores (I'll make a post about them soon) - and
    for my surprised I found a really good book!
 </p>

<p>
    So without think twice I bought <b>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</b> by
    <b>John K. Ousterhout</b> with is the guy that created Tcl and Tk! I can't
    say how luck I was to find that book ;D
</p>

<p>
    Now there's nothing to stop me doing what I want to do in <tt><b>git gui</b></tt>.
    Of course I'll try to make my changes accepted by the community - I don't know
    if them are valuable enough to make they be accepted, but I already have some
    people that I talked about it and they said that even the changes wouldn't be
    accepted they want my fork anyway!
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Final stuff:</h2>
<p>
    Well that's it! I'm <b>really happy</b> to learn a new language, probably
    help a lot of people and make the tool that I love even better!
</p>
<p>
    Thanks for reading, and here I'm with my new companion book!
