<h2>Intro: </h2>
<p>
    This week I had a friendly debate on work with my colleagues about the
    footprint that you leave on internet and how it can affect you in the
    view of the recruiters.
</p>

<p>
    I'll try in this post expose my views about the subject and with a fortunately
    persuade you to do the same! So without any further ado, let's start!
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>The discussion:</h2>
<p>
    It started as I tell them one inbox message that I received on LinkedIn
    by one of my connections that - I think in the best of intentions - advised
    me to not expose my ideas as I did.
</p>

<p>
    To contextualize, my post was:<br>
    <center><img src="../img/blog/oct_21_2017_linkedin_post.png"></center>
</p>

<p>
    The guy that replied me said that I shouldn't do that, since I'll be ill
    viewed by the recruiters and all that stuff... <br>

    Firstly, I said thanks to person that take care of me to the extend to
    let me a message warning about it. I mean, while I disagree with him, I'm
    most pleased to know that he wants the best for me and sincerely took
    some time to alert me.
</p>

<p>
    Well I did exposed the same situation for my fellow coworkers and most
    of them agreed with the message's guy. They said that, <i>..."yes, we
    should take care about we post, not only on LinkedIn, but on other social
    networks as well..."</i> and <i>..."no matter how good you're on the tech side,
    some recruiters aren't or don't care about it at first glance, and you might
    lose a job opportunity by doing that"...</i>
</p>

<p>
    Again, I thanks by the alert (for real), but I <b>strongly</b> disagree
    with all of them, so let me make my point...
</p>

<!-- Why this matter:                                                        -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Why this matter:</h2>
<p>
    Let's say that you started your career as professional by the 20 years old,
    and plan to retire on the 55 years old. <br>

    That's 35 years of work, assuming a journey of (A)8 hours a day, (B)5 days
    by week - and not considering for this count the vacation time, holidays and
    that stuff - you gonna work:
    <ul>
        <li>1 year = ~52 weeks</li>
        <li>52 weeks/year * 35 years of work = 1825 weeks</li>
        <li>1825 weeks * 5 days/week = 9125 days of work</li>
        <li>9125 days * 8 hours of work/day = 73.000 hours</li>
        <li>73.000 hours of work / 24 hours (of entire day) = ~3041 days</li>
        <li>~3041 days / 365 days/year = ~8.3 years</li>
    </ul>

    That's it, you gonna work on your life:
    <ul>
        <li><b>9125 days</b></li>
        <li><b>73.000 hours</b></li>
        <li><b>~8.3 years</b> working <b>24 hours per day</b></li>
    </ul>

    I really don't know for you, but for me that's a fucking long time.<br>
    This is a great part of the life, I mean <b>GREAT</b> part of it!
</p>

<p>
    By this calculation I just working with the <i>raw numbers</i>, I don't
    taking in account that when you are working, you're not - in the most
    common case - with the people that you love, you're not enjoying you dog,
    you're not watching you kids grow, etc. <br>

    See what I mean? If the hours aren't bad enough, when you are <i>almost</i>
    <b>obligated</b> to work to have a live in the modern society, you're being
    <b>forced</b> to not only spend a lot of time on it, but be apart of a lot
    of key points of your life.
</p>

<p>
    This led us to what I decided to do...
</p>

<h2>I give a shit about recruiters:</h2>
<p>
    Yes, I really give a shit...
</p>

<p><i>
    Addendum: I really repect the profession and the people that do recruitment.
    What I mean here, is I don't care and won't do nothing to make me more likeable
    to them if by doing that I would go against myself.
</i></p>

<p>
    I wasn't always being like that, actually I was kind of opposite, trying
    to do everything <i>"right"</i> to be <i>better</i> in their eyes.
    But when I realized that I had <b>no option</b> in the modern society to live
    without a job, and that a job <b>takes a enormous</b> amount of my time, I
    decided that I must prioritize some things, and they are:

    <ol>
        <li> I'm the <b>most important</b> "thing" on the world, exactly as <b>you're</b>!</li>
        <li> Work is <b>great</b> but comes in expense a lot of <b>great</b> things too</li>
    </ol>

    So by (1) I know that I must do everything thing that makes me happy while ensuring
    that I make all people happy too. I mustn't do anything that in conflict with myself
    just o let someone have a better impression on me.
    Please notice that you're responsible in some degree for the happiness of the other
    people too, and you shall not do anything that may harm them.
    <br>

    And by (2) I'm <b>forced</b> to exchange some key points of my life, so I'll
    try everything to have the better of the work - because I know that this is
    inevitable.
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    While (1) is very powerful the (2) led to my point here:<br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>If recruiters don't like what I say or do, this is a bless!</b> if they
    thinks that I don't fit to the company, I'm <b>sure</b> that the company
    <b>doesn't FITS me!</b>.
    <br>
    As I said, I'll spend a hell lot of time there, I want to be
    myself - remember (1)?? - I want be connected with good people that, while
    they might think differently, have the knowledge that the person is the most
    import thing.
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Conclusions:</h2>
<p>
    I won't be different just to please the business - They give a fuck for the
    individuals anyway. I won't spend my life, myself, my essence to let someone
    richer.
    <br>
    <b>I'll be myself, strive hard to be happy and make people happy!</b>
</p>

<p>
    And if by doing that I lose some job opportunities, well I don't see as I lose
    a job, but instead as I <b>won</b> more opportunities to be happy!
</p>
