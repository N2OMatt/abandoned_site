<h2>Intro: </h2>
<p>
    Summer time already began and with a hour less of sleep out week starts!<br>
    Great <s>(but not)</s>! I'm still in Curitiba, since we <b>failed</b> to
    deliver the 1.0 release.
</p>

<p>
    Today I'll try to be mindful about what went wrong and what we need to
    do to not fail next deadline.
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- What failed:                                                            -->

<h2>What failed:</h2>
<p>
    Well, we have a <i>not too complex</i> system, but yet having some challenges
    about it. I mean, the programming part is <i>almost trivial</i>
    (with some caveats listed bellow), but the business part is <b>very troublesome</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The mis-understanding about the business part of the application led to a
    situation where, in some critical parts of the application, no one
    understand what's to implement and/or how it should be implemented.
</p>
<p>
    This led to a situation where, a day before release <i>(When I said day, you
    can safely read - Some hours before)</i> some mis-interpretations about what
    a specific part of program should do, popped out.<br>
    And as all we know this can only mean on thing: A complete <b>disaster</b>!
</p>

<p>
    The result was a sub-optimal product that we decide to not release yet.
    This was a wise decision since, by the time that the product is release
    we must take reposability for what we delivered.
</p>

<p>
    So this week is being very busy, fixing all the bugs that we found along
    the way and trying to make the code more robust and stable at same time.<br>
    I know, we're doing it wrong, but it's what we have for now...
</p>

<!-- Why we failed:                                                          -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Why we failed:</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The technology chosen was sub-optimal for what we're doing currently.
        </li>
        We're fast moving and while we have a big picture of what we're trying
        to achieve, the minor details (and they did show that they count up) are
        very hidden. <br>
        A relational database with a language with a slow development
        turn around is very sub-optimal in my option. <br>
        The best option is using a NoSQL database with a language
        that's more fit to a rapid development like python or ruby.

        <li>
            Too many key people changes...
        </li>
        In a period of 3 or 4 months the project changed direction 3 times. This
        was due the <i>architects</i> being fired by not deliver what was expected
        from them.<br>
        Needless to say that I face a very difficult challenge where I have to
        design the system built upon a very fragmented and weak structure.

        <li>
            Lack of testers...
        </li>
        The majority of the bugs aren't, <i>to say</i>, code bugs, but domain
        bugs. Summed up with the lack of a user "testing" the application to
        ensure that it's what the client wants, makes everything really error prone.

        <li>
            Not everyone is playing by the same rules!
        </li>
        This is the worst thing that can happen in a team and unfortunately
        we faced it. Some people just hidden information about the status of
        their work and at the last corner of at last lap it was shown.
    </ul>
</p>

<!-- Next Steps:                                                             -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>
    We have so many challenges and issues to overcome, that's really hard
    to enumerate them all, but we can <i>more or less</i> split them in two
    sets of problems:

    Short-term problems (That needs to be addressed quickly to next deliver):
    <ol>
        <li>Close all bugs possible until the end of week.</li>
        <li>Test every change against what we think that user wants </li>
        <li>Write down all the key points that will be need to be refactored</li>
    </ol>

    Long-term problems (Stuff that we need address after we finish this release):
    <ol>
        <li>A more clear division of the work.</li>
        Today we don't have a clear separation of each person responsibilities.<br>
        So as expected this leads to the situation that some stuff is neglect and
        other stuff generates a lot of friction between the members of the team.

        <li>A stop and <b>REFACTOR</b></li>
        The project will suffer and probably will be dead really soon if we
        won't stop and rethink its design and implementation.

        <li>Move towards a mindset of <b>GET THE SHIT DONE</b></li>
        Today we're really verbose, too much stupid and needless meetings to
        reach nothing. Would be great define what's to be achieve and just
        do it®.
    </ol>

<h2> Final Considerations:</h2>
<p>
    I just want finish that and go home! No more chit chat, no more bullshit!<br>
    Let's work hard and finish that!
