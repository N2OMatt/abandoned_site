<h2>About Curitiba: </h2>
<p>
    This is my first time here and I'm really loving the city. While is true
    that I didn't hang around until now - I arrived Sunday - the city already
    let a very good impression on me.
</p>
<p>
    The streets are <b>super clean</b>, the people are very educated and willing
    to help you. Food is <i>"cheap"</i> and where I'm located is very near from
    anywhere else that I might be interested at first glance.
</p>
<p>
    Well.. I'm loving here ;D and I hope that the next two weeks to be great
    like now!
</p>

<h2>About my new Host: </h2>
<p>
    I used to use a shared host from GoDaddy, it was a GNU/Linux machine - if
    I remember correctly, it was a CentOS.
</p>
<p>
    While it <i>cheap</i>, around R$12/month, the service was very, very disappointing.<br>
    I had a <b>ultra</b> limited usage possibilities, since every thing that uses
    CPU or Disk for more than a couple of seconds were killed.
</p>
<p>
    This clearly doesn't works well for me - While my usage is very low in average
    there are some times that I need use some CPU time, especially to build the
    <a href="http://www.amazingcow.com">Amazing Cow's</a> projects documentation
    using doxygen.<br>

    So, this is why, both my and Amazing Cow's site was very outdated...
    I simply can't built them...
</p>

<p>
    Now I decided to move to a VPS hosting (hostinger). <br>
    Well I can't say anything but that I'm really amazed in...:
    <ol>
        <li>How the hostinger control panel is awesome - Very concise, clean, without anything unneeded...</li>
        <li>How is <b>good</b> have unrestricted GNU/Linux machine at your hands...</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    I would tell here how my experience with the actual systems management is going...
    but I think that it's a nice subject to another post - and I'll let it for later!
