HI there! ;D

## Intro:

I want to share my experience of porting some of my stuff to BSD!

## Motivation:

Well, shortly (I hope) I'll move to Lisbon - Portugal to join the Miniclip
Web Client team - I can't be more happier ;D. So I asked them which OS I'll
use and the reply was astonishing...

I'll use OSX - Well I very happy that won't be Windows, but still isn't GNU/Linux.
Since the OSX uses the BSD user land, instead of the much superior GNU one, I
tought that would be wiser to start porting my stuff to the BSD, so when I get
in the job, I can just install everything and dive deep to the actual work!

I'll not get into the details of each program - but I'll let the link for the
ones that are interested enough to learn about them - but I'll try to explain
why went wrong and needed to be changed.

Mostly of the programs that I ported were or, bash scripts, or python scripts.
Like I said, I'm porting the stuff that I really use on my day to day and that
I can't live without. I so used to them that when I get a machine without them
I feel very, very <i>naked</i>...

## Caveat

I had no OSX at moment, my Amanda is with my friend and the fucker is traveling!
So for the good or the bad I'll porting firstly to FreeBSD - actually GhostBSD.

So for what I can remember, some issues wouldn't apply directly to OSX since
it change some defaults of the BSDs, but still with the porting process I
learned a lot of stuff and make my code more robust!

When I refer to GNU/Linux, bear in mind that I'm using Xubuntu-Core and the
default may vary from other distros - but I found that what I'm saying applies
for all distros that I worked on (CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuse).

When I refer to BSD, I'm actually meaning GhostBSD that the BSD that I had
exposure, besides the OSX itself. I have little knowlegde about BSDs in general
so take easy, and if I say anything wrong, <b>please correct me</b>!

## General issues:

The major issue was the <a >shabang lines</a>. On GNU/Linux - and I think with
OSX as well - the default shell is bash and it's installed on /usr/bin/bash.
The same goes for python, it's default installed on /usr/bin/python.

But on BSD


## Programs that I ported so far:

- bash_status_line
- DownloadRepos
- dots
- dots_utils
- gosh (pkg-config is very different...)
  $HOME is /usr/home

     The issue was: realpath vs abspath.
- cowtodo: Just the shebang.

COREFS
    - New add some macros.

    program_invocation_name

This was trick one to port, correctly. Like all other scripts
