Today I just want to escape a little bit from the blog's thematic and write
about Pingo.

About five years ago, I was in Belo Horizonte, capital of state of Minas Gerais - Brazil,
when the most adorable creature - even if I didn't know at the time - was born.
He's offspring of another dog of mine (Chocolate) and at time my girlfriend's dog (Milk).

Milk gave birth to only two dogs, namely Pingo and Biscoito and at first we decided
that Pingo will be my ex-girlfriend dog and Biscoito would be mine. Some weeks passed
and <s>un</s>fortunately she can't stay with Pingo. I don't remember why, but I
think that was why as she already owned two other dogs her mother doesn't want another
one.

Firstly I get Pingo temporally, we would find another house to him, but at end we
found another house to Biscoito, since I get very, very bonded with his immensely
joy and love.

Well, I moved from Belo Horizonte to my hometown, then I moved to SÃ£o Paulo, then
now I'm moving to Lisbon - Portugal, and every single time Pingo was/is with me.

Fortune gave me the most adorable dog that I would ever want in my entire life, and
while I hope that Pingo stays a lot of time with me, I would give him back to fortune,
when his time came, because I'm very happy to have the opportunity - in the extreme
improbable and rare event of life - to share some time with him!

Pingo, thanks to be you!
Thanks to be with me!

I love you!
