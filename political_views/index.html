<!-- Intro                                                                   -->

<h1> My political views: </h1>
<p>
    Here a quick list of my political / life views. While it's clear that:
    <ol>
        <li> No one can summarize all points into a single webpage, </li>
        <li> All of the subjects are open to change due new evidences, and </li>
        <li> This list can't be ever completed and fully updated </li>
    </ol>
    I think that's a good way to express my point of view about many subjects
    that I think interesting ;D
</p>

<p>
    I'm <b>OPEN TO CHANGE</b> all of the subjects, if you disagree with that
    I would love to hear you and learn about how your thought is constructed.

    <li><b>Science</b></li>
    The <b>most important</b> thing that humans had invented. Only by science
    the knowledge can be acquired in a true way.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>god</b></li>
    I don't believe in any form of god - I respect you by believe, but yet
    think that you should think more about it, because I think that there's
    no logical way that you can make up a god and make the reasoning holds up
    without inconsistencies.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Religion</b></li>
    While I respect the right of the existence of any religion I'm fully against
    the concept of its existence. I don't think that it brings nothing valuable
    for life, in any form.

<!-- LGBT                                                                    -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>LGBT</b></li>
    I fully believe that the LGBT community <b>MUST HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS</b> of the
    heterosexual community. There's <b>nothing wrong</b> being LGBT, in ANY aspect.

<!-- Gay Marriage / Children Adoption                                        -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Gay Marriage / Children Adoption</b></li>
    Really? I'm fully agree with that. In respect about the children - the younglings
    needs are: Care, Love, Education, a strong moral teaching - the sexual organ
    of their parents don't enter at this list ;D
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Education                                                               -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Education</b></li>
    I think that it's the strongest and more important thing that a human being
    must have. By the education one can reason by himself - And that's the most
    important thing that a person might have.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Social / Economical</b></li>
    That's trick... While I'm not a socialist <i>stricto sensu</i> I'm inclined
    to be considered one. I really believe that <b>we must look for each other</b>
    in all things imaginable and the socialism is the only thing that I know
    today that do that (yet it's far from be perfect).

<!-- Legalization / Decriminalization of drugs                               -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Legalization / Decriminalization of drugs</b></li>
    We can see cases of success in countries that allowed some drugs to be
    used by citizens. Holland, Uruguay and USA is the most prominent ones.<br>
    Besides that we can see how effective is the policy of "drugs as public health
    issue" that some European countries have.<br>
    I can enumerate (<i>and I'll do shortly...</i>) a number of reasons of why
    I think that <b>Marijuana</b> must be <b>legal</b> and other drugs must
    be treated as <b>public health</b> issue    .

<!-- Abortion                                                                 -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
    <li><b>Abortion</b></li>
    With <i>one exception</i> I think that this is a decision
    regarding <b>only</b> the woman.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>only</b> exception is, when the couple decided together to have
    a baby and later on the other part don't want anymore. I think that those
    cases need a very deep moral and logical analysis to ensure that the right
    thing to do is achieved.
